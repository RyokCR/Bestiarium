          ' very similar in texture and qualities to raw meat, hence its name. It is a'
          ' delicacy food to local tribes, which prepare it in a variety of ways. Many'
          ' jewelery items and accessories are also fashioned from the large seeds of'
          ' the fleshfruit, similar to bone in color and hardness.',
